- [ ] sort three papers which are related to improvement of fidelity by interacting with local environmentï¼š
      1. Bell's Inequalities versus Teleportation : What is Nonlocality?
          2. Local environment can enhance fidelity of quantum teleportation
          3. Origin of noisy states whose teleportation fidelity can be enhanced through dissipation. 
- [x]  1. some mixed states not violating Bell inequaity can be used for teleportation.
- [x]  2. some non-teleporting states (f>=1/2) can be used for teleportation after being subjected to a dissipative interaction with local environment.
- [x]   3. one of two-particle entangled pair being  subjected to  amplitude damping may be a mixed state whose fully entangled fraction f is smaller than 1/2. Then letting another particle to be interacted with amplitude damping, with appropriate damping parameter, the fully entangled fraction f can be  greater than 1/2, making the noisy state from nonteleporting state to teleporting state. 
- [ ] continue to calculating the computing part of my paper.
- [ ] The nonlocality responsible for violation of Bell inequality is not equal to that used in teleportation. It is to say that states not involating Bell equality may be used for teleportation.
