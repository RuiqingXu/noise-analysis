### Fighting noise with noise in realistic quantum teleportation
##### less entanglement means more efficiency
- this  verdict depends on the representation of quantum channel, an arbitrary known  two-qubit entangled state

- when input state is affected by bit-flip channel and Bob's qubit, his share of entangled channel, may lie in one of the four different types of noise environment, the average fidelity is calculated as follows:![41](C:\Users\许瑞青\Desktop\常\41.PNG)
the corresponding simulation results are presented by four unumbiguous pictures

>interpretation:
>the solid black circle is in the situation that  the amounts of entanglement are maximum, equal  to Bob's qubit is noiseless.. 
>It is obvious that when input state affected by bit-flip for a long time, some of the for different efficiency are  higher than the solid black circle.   

##### more noise leads to more efficiency
##### the optimal combination of noisy environments lead to highest efficiency.
##### In the noise environment, the choice of different quantum channel can affect efficiency of teleportation protocol
