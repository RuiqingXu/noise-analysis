### Fighting noise with noise in realistic quantum teleportation
##### less entanglement means more efficiency
- this  verdict depends on the representation of quantum channel, an arbitrary known  two-qubit entangled state ![Image](https://github.com/RuiqingXu/noise-analysis/blob/master/1.PNG)
- when input state is affected by bit-flip channel and Bob's qubit, his share of entangled channel, may lie in one of the four different types of noise environment, the average fidelity is calculated as follows:

- the corresponding simulation results are presented by four unambiguous pictures

> interpretation:

> the solid black curve is in the situation that  the amounts of entanglement in quantum channel  are maximum, equal  to Bob's qubit is noiseless.. 

> It is obvious that when input state affected by bit-flip for a long time, some of the four different efficiency are  higher than the solid black curve. Such as Alice's input state is subjected to bit-flip noise and Bob's qubit, his share of quantum entangled channel, is affected by the same noise as Alice's.

> That  is to say although  quantum channel is a mixed state, its efficiency can also be higher than that  of  maximally entangled state as quantum channel in QT protocol.  

##### more noise leads to more efficiency
- from the second figure, we found that when only  input state is subjected to one of the four noise, the linear increase of noise intensity results in the linear decrease of efficiency![Image](https://github.com/RuiqingXu/noise-analysis/blob/master/4.PNG)
- from the first figure, when input state and Bob's qubit are subjected to noise, the efficiency may be increased if choosing appropriate noisy intensity.  
##### the optimal combination of noisy environments lead to highest efficiency.
- there exists some cases that more noise may only relatively improve efficiency, such as the third figure and the forth figure.![Image](https://github.com/RuiqingXu/noise-analysis/blob/master/5.PNG) ![Image](https://github.com/RuiqingXu/noise-analysis/blob/master/6.PNG)
> Interpretation:
> from the above two figures, it is clear that each of the four color line can not exceed the black solid curve, so its efficiency can only be locally improved by increasing the the noise intensity of input state or Bob's qubit 
> the way to increase noise intensity is letting qubit be subjected to noise for a long time.
