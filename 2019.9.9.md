### 任务
- [ ] 完成 local environment can enhance fidelity of quantum teleportation的阅读，并做好笔记
- [ ] 阅读智能优化算法的第一章



### 重点基础问题
- [ ] the optimal strategy of classical communication(经典传送信息的方式是如何)
  - [x]  1. Alice performs an optimal measurement of the system to be teleported and sends the outcome to Bob (classically) (Alice对待传送的系统进行优化测量，并将结果以经典的方式传送给Bob)
  - [x]  2. On the basis of her results, Bob tries to reconstruct the state. (在Alice结果的基础上，Bob重构出态信息)
- [ ] the formula of classical communication (经典传送信息的保真度的表示方式) 
  - [x] 3. The optimal teleportation for this strategy is equal to the optimal fidelity of the state estimate for a single system

- [ ] 量子信息的传送在何种情况下会不如经典信息的传送
  
  - [x]   Interactions with the environment and imperfections of preparation result in Alice and Bob sharing a state which is always  mixed. So, when Bob rescontructs the state initially held by Alice, the teleported state can only be a distorted one. Moreover, if the bipartite state is mixed too much,it will not provide for any better transmission fidelity than that of an ordinary classical communication.  
- [ ] 量子信息的传送如何才能获得非经典的保真度
  - [x] 1.To do better than a classical channel, the shared channel must be entangled. 
  - [x] 2. let some states interact with dissipative environment.
  - [x] 3. a restricted condition that is a fully completed entangledt fraction of quantum channel must be greater than 1/d. (d: Hilbert space)
- [ ] the derivation of the restricted condition
  - [x] the maximal fidelity of the standard quantum teleportation is  
      ![Image](https://github.com/RuiqingXu/noise-analysis/blob/master/9.PNG)

  from the above formula,  f is the fully entangled fraction, so when in SQT, the quantum channel is a singlet state. 
  - [x] One can easily see now that, in order to perform better than classical communication, we must make the second formula be greater than the first formula.
