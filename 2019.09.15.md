- [ ]  calculating the average fidelity when quantum channel is subjected to bit flip and qauntum unitary operation is affected by amplitude damping. 
- [x] when P<1/2, the average fidelity becomes larger as the damping parameter gets bigger. However, when damping parameter reachs the limit 1, whatever the intensity of bit-flip, the average fidelity will maintain to 0.6333.
